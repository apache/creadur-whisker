Parameterising a Template for a License Family

 {{{http://creadur.apache.org/whisker} Apache Whisker}} is based around
 {{{../meta-data.html}meta-data}} describing the licensing qualities
 of documents included within
 {{{../faq.html#complex-software-applications}complex software distributions}}.
 Whisker just helps to maintain information more efficiently, and is
 {{{../faq.html#what-whisker-is-not}no substitute}}
 for solid legal work.
 Learn about copyright and software licensing {{{../faq.html#more-resources'}here}}.

 For this example, we'll add the meta-data for a third party work whose
 license is parameterised using a
 {{{../faq.html#what-is-license-family}license family}} template,
 featuring the
    {{{http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause}BSD (2 Clause) license}}

 If this isn't quite what you're looking for, take a look at:

   * {{{./in-5-mins.html}Whisker in 5 minutes}}, an MIT licensed project

   * including a 3rd Party work licensed by

       * an {{{./3rd-party-individual.html}individual}}

       * a for- or non-profit
         {{{./3rd-party-corporate.html}corporation}}

       * an {{{./3rd-party-group.html}informal group}}

   * All about {{{./copyright-notices.html}copyright notices}}

* The Story So Far

  Let's assume <<<foo>>> is a simple project,
  with a single original source file: <<<HelloWorld.py>>>.
  The source for <<<foo>>> looks something like:

+---------------------------------------+
  foo--|
       | HelloWorld.py
       | LICENSE
+---------------------------------------+

** Starting Definitions

  Whisker describes each {{{../faq.html#what-is-a-license}license}},
  {{{../faq.html#what-notice}notice}}
  and {{{../faq.html#what-is-org}organisation}} once
  above, and then {{{../faq.html#why-ids}references by id}} below. So, the meta-data for
  project <<<foo>>> is structured along these lines:

+---------------------------------------+
<manifest>
    <!-- Definitions -->
    <licenses>...</licenses>
    <notices>...</notices>
    <organisations>...</organisations>
    <primary-license>...</primary-license>
    <primary-notice>...</primary-notice>
    <primary-organisation>...</primary-organisation>
    ...
+---------------------------------------+

  Let's say that the
  {{{http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html}Apache License, Version 2}}
  is the {{{../faq.html#what-is-primary}primary license}}
  for the project, but <<<foo>>> opts not to
  {{{../faq.html#notice-needed-for-al2}include a primary notice}}.
  The text for this license is included in <<<licenses>>> above,
  and this data is referenced by <<<id>>> as <<<primary-license>>> below:

+---------------------------------------+

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    <primary-license id='osi:AL2'/>
    <primary-notice/>
    <primary-organisation>...</primary-organisation>
    ...
+---------------------------------------+

  Let's assume that our project <<<foo>>> is here at Apache. So the
  {{{../faq.html#what-is-primary}primary organisation}} is the
  {{{http://www.apache.org/foundation}Apache Software Foundation}}.
  This organisation is described once in <<<organisations>>> (above) then
  referenced by id as the
  <<<primary-organisation>>> (below).

+---------------------------------------+
<manifest>
    ...
    <organisations>
        <organisation
            id='apache.org'
            name='The Apache Software Foundation'
            url='http://www.apache.org/'/>
    </organisations>
    ...
    <primary-organisation id='apache.org'/>
    ...
+---------------------------------------+

** Starting Contents

  Let's assume that the distribution for <<<foo>>> just contains the single
  source file <<<HelloWorld.py>>> (plus legal documentation generated by Whisker),
  like this:

+---------------------------------------+
  foo--|
       | HelloWorld.py
+---------------------------------------+

  The contents section of the meta-data should look quite a lot like:

+---------------------------------------+
    ...
    <!-- Contents -->
    <within dir='.'>
        <with-license id='osi:AL2'>
            <by-organisation id='apache.org'>
                <resource name='HelloWorld.py'/>
            </by-organisation>
        </with-license>
    </within>
</manifest>
+---------------------------------------+

   It is essential that the <<<id>>> attributes in the <<<with-license>>>
   and <<<by-organisation>>> elements match the ids assigned above. This
   allows the details entered above to be re-used consistently.

* Adding A Third Party Work to the Distribution

  Let's add <<<boo.png>>> to the distribution,
  licensed with the
  {{{http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause}BSD (2 Clause) license}}
  from the (hypothetical) <Example Project>. The license shipped is

  Yes, the license is indeed part of the BSD (2 Clause) license family.
  Checking <<<licenses>>> verifies that we need to add this as a new
  template <<<license>>> with two parameters. We have a
  {{{../faq.html#parameter-name-freedom}free choice}}
  of <<<parameter-name>>> but it's conventional to reuse (where possible)
  standard names - in this case <<<YEAR>>> and <<<OWNER>>>.
  Define them within in a <<<template>>> element and then values
  will be substituted for <<<$\{YEAR\}>>> and <<<$\{OWNER\}>>> within
  the text.

            </text>
        </license>
        ...
+---------------------------------------+

 Comparing the text of the license instance with the template (we just created),
 we find that <<<YEAR>>> should be <2000-2010> and
 <<<OWNER>>> should be <The Example Project>. We'll need to
 add these later as <<<license-parameters>>>.
 We note the {{{../faq.html#id-freedom}id chosen}}
 - <<<osi:BSD2>>> - for {{{../faq.html#why-ids}later}}.


** Add Organisation

  After verifying that <The Example Project> isn't already
  described in the <<<organisations>>>, we add this new
  <<<organisation>>>, noting the
  {{{../faq.html#id-freedom}id chosen}} for
  {{{../faq.html#why-ids}later}}.
  (Read more about adding organisations
  {{{../faq.html#add-org-example}here}}.)

+---------------------------------------+
<manifest>
    <organisations>
    ...
        <organisation
           id='example.org'
           name='The Example Project'
           url='http://example.org/'
        />
    </organisations>
    ...
+---------------------------------------+

** Add Contents

  Excluding the legal documentation to be generated by Whisker,
  suppose that the contents of the new distribution are:

+---------------------------------------+
  foo--|
       | HelloWorld.py
       | boo.png         <- Newly added
+---------------------------------------+

  We need to add <<<boo.png>>> to the
  {{{../faq.html#how-contents}contents}},
  into a new group of resources
  within the {{{../faq.html#how-root-dir}root directory}}.
  Within each <<<dir>>>, resources contained within the
  directory are grouped <<<with-license>>>. The new resource
  - <<<boo.png>>> - is the first with the <BSD (2 Clause) License>,
  so we need to add a new <<<with-license>>> with <<<id>>>
  attribute <<<osi:BSD2>>>, the <<<id>>> we chose when we
  added the license earlier.

+---------------------------------------+
    ...
    <within dir='.'>
        ...
        <with-license id='osi:BSD2'>
        </with-license>
        ...
+---------------------------------------+

  The <<<license>>> we added earlier is a template,
  so we need to include the parameter values
  as <<<license-parameters>>>. These will be substituted
  into the template when rendering the license instance text.
  We enter the values we noted above

+---------------------------------------+
    ...
    <within dir='.'>
        ...
        <with-license id='osi:BSD2'>
            <license-parameters>
                <parameter>
                    <name>YEAR</name>
                    <value>2000-2010</value>
                </parameter>
                <parameter>
                    <name>OWNER</name>
                    <value>The Example Project</value>
                </parameter>
            </license-parameters>
        </with-license>
        ...
+---------------------------------------+

  Within each license, resources are grouped by organisation.
  So the <<<by-organisation>>> containing
  the new resource named <<<boo.png>>> needs to
  {{{../faq.html#why-ids}refer}} (by <<<id>>>)
  to the <<<organisation>>> we added earlier - <<<example.org>>>.

+---------------------------------------+
    ...
    <within dir='.'>
        ...
        <with-license id='osi:BSD2'>
            <license-parameters>
                <parameter>
                    <name>YEAR</name>
                    <value>2000-2010</value>
                </parameter>
                <parameter>
                    <name>OWNER</name>
                    <value>The Example Project</value>
                </parameter>
            </license-parameters>
            <by-organisation id='example.org'>
                <resource name='boo.png'/>
            </by-organisation>
        </with-license>
    ...
+---------------------------------------+

  That's about all there is to adding <<<boo.png>>>,
  a new BSD (2 Clause) licensed resource.

* And Finally

  We end up with this meta-data
  ({{{./license-family-sample.xml}open}}

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
